#In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and compute the sum of the numbers.
# Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_42.txt (There are 90 values with a sum=445833)
# Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/regex_sum_395821.txt (There are 63 values and the sum ends with 400)
#The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of '[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers. 

import re
#import os

#cwd = os.getcwd()
#print(cwd)

handle = open('ActualData.txt')
numlist = []

for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    nums = re.findall('[0-9]+', line)
    
    for num in nums:
        num = int(num)
        if num > 0:
            numlist.append(num)
    
print(sum(numlist))
