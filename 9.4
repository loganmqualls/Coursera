#Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)

emails = list()
counts = dict()

for line in handle:
	if not line.startswith('From:'): continue
	words = line.split()
	emails.append(words[1])

for e in emails:
    counts[e] = counts.get(e,0) + 1

max_sender = None
max_sent = None

for word,count in counts.items():
    if max_sent is None or count > max_sent:
        max_sent = count
        max_sender = word
print(max_sender,max_sent)
